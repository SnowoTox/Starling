# Starling
Starling is a C# Library which gives access to the Playstation 3 console through PS3MAPI, CCAPI, TMAPI and Webman.

This project is currently unfinished and may contain some error, please report any errors that you encounter.

Please note that some codes were taken from other projects like PS3ManagerAPI.dll or PS3Lib.dll.
This is beacuse to bring a stable Starling version way faster and to save some time.

# Other informations

Starling's Webman functions were not copied from Sinful Butterfly's project "Webman Windows" project. I was also working on the same type of project when he didn't release or told anything.

Starling features as much as PS3Lib when it's about CCAPI and has way more functions when it's about TMAPI.

Starling uses the 2015 version (Version 1.12, current is 1.20) for PS3MAPI, but will update as fast as possible to version 1.20.
